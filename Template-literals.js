//WHAT IS TEMPLATE-LITERALS

/*Template literals, also known as template strings, are a
 feature in JavaScript introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).
  They allow you to create strings with embedded expressions,
   making it easier to concatenate variables and perform
 string interpolation within a string literal. Template 
 literals are enclosed in backticks (``) rather than single or
  double quotes.  */

  const variable = "world";
const greeting = `Hello, ${variable}!`;
console.log(greeting);
