/*Destructuring in JavaScript is a way to extract values from
 objects or arrays and assign them to variables in a concise and
  convenient manner. It allows you to extract specific properties 
  or elements from a complex data structure, such as an object or
   an array, and assign them to individual variables. */

/* const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  country: 'USA'
};

// Destructuring assignment
const { name, age, country } = person;

console.log(name);     // 'John Doe'
console.log(age);      // 30
console.log(country);  // 'USA' */
   // Destructuring provides a concise way to extract values from 
   //objects and arrays, making it easier to work with complex data structures in JavaScript.

   /* Destructuring helps simplify code and make it more readable by providing 
   a concise syntax for extracting values from complex data structures.
    It is widely used in JavaScript for tasks like extracting function
     parameters, working with API responses, or accessing nested data structures. */


     // EX..
     /*  const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
const [firstFruit, secondFruit, thirdFruit] = fruits;

console.log(firstFruit);  // Output: 'apple'
console.log(secondFruit); // Output: 'banana'
console.log(thirdFruit);  // Output: 'orange'  */
