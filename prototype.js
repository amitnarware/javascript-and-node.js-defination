//  Prototype

/*In JavaScript, the prototype is an internal property of every 
object that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from
 other objects. It is a mechanism that enables object-oriented 
 features like inheritance and property sharing.

Every object in JavaScript has an associated prototype object, 
which may itself have a prototype, forming a prototype chain.
 When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript 
 first looks for that property or method directly on the object.
  If it doesn't find it, it continues searching up the prototype 
  chain until it either finds the property/method or reaches the 
  end of the chain (which is typically the Object.prototype). */
