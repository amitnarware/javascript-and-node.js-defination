 //                EVENT HANDLER

/*In JavaScript, an event handler is a function or a piece of code that responds to 
events triggered by user interactions or other sources. Events can include things 
like mouse clicks, keyboard input, changes in the document structure, and more. Event
 handlers are used to define the behavior or actions that should be taken when a 
 specific event occurs. */
