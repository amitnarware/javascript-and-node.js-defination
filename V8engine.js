/* The "V8 engine" in JavaScript refers to an open-source, high-performance 
JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and is
 responsible for executing JavaScript code in Google Chrome, Node.js,
  and other environments.

The V8 engine is designed to optimize the execution of JavaScript
 by translating JavaScript code into machine code that can be 
 executed directly by the computer's processor. This just-in-time
  (JIT) compilation process significantly boosts the performance 
  of JavaScript applications, making them run much faster than 
  traditional interpreters.

Key features of the V8 engine include:

1--Just-in-time compilation: V8 compiles JavaScript code into 
optimized machine code on the fly, enabling faster execution.

2.--Garbage collection: It manages memory automatically by periodically 
detecting and cleaning up unused objects (garbage) to prevent memory 
leaks and improve performance.

3.--Hidden class transitions: V8 optimizes property access in objects
 using hidden classes, which leads to faster property lookups.

4.--Inline caching: V8 employs inline caching to optimize function 
calls by caching the resolved function pointers, which results in 
faster subsequent calls.

5..Ignition and TurboFan: V8 consists of two compilers: Ignition 
(an interpreter) and TurboFan (an optimizing compiler). Ignition
 quickly generates bytecode, while TurboFan performs more extensive
  optimizations on the bytecode.

V8's performance improvements have significantly contributed to the 
overall speed and responsiveness of modern web applications and
 have made JavaScript a viable choice for various server-side 
 applications through Node.js. Many other JavaScript engines have 
 been influenced by V8's design and have also adopted similar 
 optimization techniques to improve their performance.  */
