//WHAT IS MEMORIZATION IN JS

/*
In JavaScript, memoization is an optimization technique used
 to speed up the execution of functions by caching the results
  of expensive function calls and returning the cached result 
  when the same inputs occur again. It's particularly useful 
  for functions that are computationally expensive and 
  frequently called with the same arguments, as it can save
   computation time. */
