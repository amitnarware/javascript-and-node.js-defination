// QUES --WHAT IS DIFF BETWEEN RETURNING A CALL BACK AND CALLING A CALLBACK ?

/*  Returning a callback: 
In returning a callback, the called function returns a callback 
instead of executing it immediately. The calling code where the 
callback is returned can execute the returned callback immediately,
 pass it to some other function and so on. Lets see an example of a 
 function that returns a callback function.

 Calling a callback: 
 In contrast to returning a callback function, 
 calling a callback function is simply the immediate execution of 
 the callback function. Lets see an example of calling a callback 
 function.  */
