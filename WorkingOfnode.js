/*Node.js is a server-side, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript 
runtime environment built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
 It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web
browser, enabling them to build scalable and efficient network
 applications. Here's an overview of how Node.js works:

JavaScript Runtime: Node.js provides an environment for executing
 JavaScript code on a server or any other computing environment.
It includes the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine 
used by Google Chrome to execute JavaScript code. V8 compiles
 JavaScript code into machine code for faster execution.

Event-Driven and Non-Blocking I/O: One of the key features of 
Node.js is its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Instead of
using traditional synchronous (blocking) I/O, where each I/O 
operation waits for the previous one to complete, Node.js uses
asynchronous operations. When an asynchronous operation 
(like reading a file or making an HTTP request) is initiated,
Node.js continues executing the rest of the code without waiting
for the operation to finish. Once the operation is complete, a 
callback function is called to handle the result.

Single-Threaded Event Loop: Node.js operates on a single-threaded 
event loop. This means that it uses a single main thread to process 
incoming requests and perform I/O operations. The event loop
 continuously checks for new events (such as incoming HTTP requests
 or completed I/O operations) and executes the associated callbacks. While I/O operations are non-blocking and handled asynchronously, CPU-bound tasks can block the event loop and should be avoided or delegated to worker threads if necessary.

Modules and NPM: Node.js provides a module system that allows 
developers to organize their code into reusable modules. Each module
can export functions, objects, or classes that can be used by other parts of the application. Additionally, Node.js has a vast ecosystem of third-party modules available through the Node Package Manager (NPM). NPM is a package manager that simplifies the process of installing, managing, and sharing libraries and tools with the community.

Web Server and Network Applications: Node.js is often used to build
 web servers and network applications. It includes built-in modules
 such as http and https, which make it easy to create and handle HTTP/HTTPS servers and clients. Developers can use these modules to handle incoming requests, process data, and respond to clients, all using JavaScript.

Real-Time Applications: Due to its event-driven architecture and 
non-blocking I/O, Node.js is well-suited for building real-time 
applications like chat applications, online gaming, collaborative 
tools, and more. Libraries like Socket.io provide easy-to-use tools
 for building real-time features. */
