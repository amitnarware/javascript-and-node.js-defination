/*The reason why it might appear that let and const are not hoisted
 is due to a concept called the "Temporal Dead Zone" (TDZ). 
 When variables declared with let and const are hoisted, they are not
  accessible or usable until their declaration statement is encountered in 
  the code. */

  // In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

//In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
